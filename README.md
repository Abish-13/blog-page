## 🛠️ Key Concepts & Skills Demonstrated

This project is not just a static page; it's a demonstration of key front-end skills required for any internship or junior role:

* **Semantic HTML:** Structuring the page logically with HTML5 tags. This is crucial for accessibility and team collaboration.
* **CSS Flexbox:** Using `display: flex` with `justify-content: space-between` to build a robust and flexible header layout.
* **CSS Box Model:** Expert use of `padding`, `margin`, `border`, and `box-shadow` to control spacing and create the visual hierarchy.
* **Responsive Design:** Using `@media` queries to adapt the layout for mobile devices, a non-negotiable skill in modern web development.
* **CSS Variables (implied):** (If you were to expand this, using CSS variables for colors and fonts would be the next step for maintainability).
